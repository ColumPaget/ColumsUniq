About uniq

uniq reports or filters out repeated lines in a file.
Syntax
uniq [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
Description

uniq filters out adjacent, matching lines from input file INPUT, writing the filtered data to output file OUTPUT.

 If INPUT is not specified, uniq reads from the standard input.

 If OUTPUT is not specified, uniq writes to the standard output.

 If no options are specified, matching lines are merged to the first occurrence. 
Options-c, --count	Prefix lines with a number representing how many times they occurred.
-d, --repeated	Only print duplicated lines.
-D, --all-repeated[=delimit-method]	Print all duplicate lines. delimit-method may be one of the following:
	none	Do not delimit duplicate lines at all. This is the default.
prepend	Insert a blank line before each set of duplicated lines.
separate	Insert a blank line between each set of dupliated lines.

 The -D option is the same as specifying --all-repeated=none. 
-f N, --skip-fields=N	Avoid comparing the first N fields of a line before determining uniqueness. A field is a group of characters, delimited by whitespace.

 This option is useful, for instance, if your document's lines are numbered, and you want to compare everything in the line except the line number. If the option -f 1 were specified, the adjacent lines 

1 This is a line. 
2 This is a line.
 would be considered identical. If no -f option were specified, they would be considered unique.
-i, --ignore-case	Normally, comparisons are case-sensitive. This option performs case-insensitive comparisons instead.
-s N, --skip-chars=N	Avoid comparing the first N characters of each line when determining uniqueness. This is like the -f option, but it skips individual characters rather than fields.
-u, --unique	Only print unique lines.
-z, --zero-terminated	End lines with 0 byte (NULL), instead of a newline.
-w, --check-chars=N	Compare no more than N characters in lines.
--help	Display a help message and exit.
--version	Output version information and exit.

Notes

uniq does not detect repeated lines unless they are adjacent. You may want to sort the input first, or use sort -u instead of uniq. 
Examples

Let's say we have an eight-line text file, myfile.txt, which contains the following text:
This is a line.
This is a line.
This is a line.
 
This is also a line.
This is also a line.
 
This is also also a line.


Here are several ways to run uniq on this file, and the output it creates:

uniq myfile.txt
This is a line.
 
This is also a line.
 
This is also also a line.


uniq -c myfile.txt
      3 This is a line.
      1  
      2 This is also a line.
      1  
      1 This is also also a line.


uniq -d myfile.txt
This is a line. 
This is also a line. 


uniq -u myfile.txt
This is also also a line.
